Avoiding the use of deprecated methods

Java concurrency API also has deprecated operations. These are operations that were
included in the first versions of the API, but now you shouldn't use them. They have been
replaced by other operations that implement better practices than the original ones.
The most critical deprecated operations are those provided by the Thread class. These
operations are:
1: destroy(): In the past, this method destroyed the thread. Actually, it throws a
NoSuchMethodError exception.
2: suspend(): This method suspends the execution of the thread until it's resumed.
3: stop(): This method forces the thread to finish its execution.
4: resume(): This method resumes the execution of the thread.
The ThreadGroup class also has some deprecated methods, which are as follows:
5: suspend(): This method suspends the execution of all the threads that belong to
this thread group until they have resumed
6: stop(): This method forces the finish of the execution of all the threads of this
thread group
7: resume(): This method resumes the execution of all the threads of this thread group
