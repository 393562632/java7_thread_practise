Using atomic variables instead of synchronization

Java's atomic variables offer a better performance than solutions based on synchronization
mechanisms. Almost all the classes in the java.util.concurrent package use atomic
variables instead of synchronization. In this recipe, you will develop an example that shows
how an atomic attribute has better performance than using synchronization.

1:AtomicBoolean
2:AtomicInteger
3:AtomicLong
4:AtomicReference
