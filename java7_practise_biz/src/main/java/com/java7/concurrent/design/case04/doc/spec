Holding locks as short a time as possible

Locks, as other synchronization mechanisms, allow the definition of a critical section that only
one thread can execute at a time. You must be very careful to define the critical section. It only
must include those instructions that really need the mutual exclusion. This is especially true if
the critical section includes long operations. If the critical section includes lengthy operations
that do not use shared resources, the application performance will be worse than it could be.
